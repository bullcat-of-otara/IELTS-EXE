# Strategies for Success in Task 2

When approaching a complex problem, it's essential to have a plan.

## 1. Break it Down
Divide the task into smaller, self-contained sub-tasks.

## 2. Research First
Don't guess. Look up documentation and examples.

## 3. Iterative Development
Build a small part, test it, then build the next part.

## Code Snippet Example

```javascript
function solveProblem(problem) {
  const subproblems = breakDown(problem);
  return subproblems.map(solve).join(' + ');
}
```
