# The Secret to a 7.5+ in IELTS Writing

Many students get stuck at Band 6.5. They have good grammar and vocabulary, yet the 7.0 or 7.5 remains elusive. Why?

## The Missing Link: Coherence & Cohesion

It's not just about using "fancy" words. It's about how your ideas flow.

### 1. Clear Paragraph Structure
Each paragraph must have a clear central topic.

### 2. Logical Progression
Your argument should develop naturally from sentence to sentence.

> "The examiner is not a mind reader. Make your path of thought obvious."

## Task Response

Did you actually answer the prompt?
- **Discuss both views:** You MUST discuss both.
- **To what extent do you agree:** You MUST state your position clearly.

## Actionable Tips

1. **Plan for 5 minutes.** Never skip planning.
2. **Review for 5 minutes.** Catch those small grammar slips.
3. **Focus on collocations**, not just isolated vocabulary.

*Keep practicing, and remember: Consistency is key.*
